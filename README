Backfester repo

This app will fetch historical data from Binance and then run a backtest. 

The strategy is buy when current price has gone down by x% and then sell when current price has gone up by x%

It is very basic and my first attempt at programming!!

In app.js the settings to change are here:

// change these as required

const exchange = 'BIN';  // Supported exchange: BIN
const pair = 'BTCUSDT';  // Supported pairs: too many look in the documentation
const interval = '1h';  // Supported Intervals: 1m,3m,5m,15m,30m,1h,2h,4h,6h,8h,12h,1d,3d,1w,1M
const sellpercent = 1.20; // When price goes up by this much, sell.
const buypercent = 1.20; // When price goes down by this much, buy.
const initialFunds = 10000; // Starting balance
